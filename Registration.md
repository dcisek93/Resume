My senior capstone project focused on image registration - mathematical approaches to aligning, adjusting, and overlaying images. This topic has huge applicability in several fields including GIS and medical imaging, and gave me a fantastic background in understanding the mathematics that govern the transformations we take for granted in GIS and computer vision applications. This was a useful bottom-up introduction to solving imagery-centric problems, and has influenced the way in which I approach problems since. On a broader level, my background in mathematics taught me a structured way to deconstruct, analyze, and solve difficult problems.
