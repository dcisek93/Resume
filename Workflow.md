In recent years the glaciology community has embraced the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for glacier mapping at scale. We've seen several organizations follow this direction, offering capabilities like the Glacier Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) project, a global database for glacier data which includes remote sensing-derived extent measurements. By leveraging remote sensing data inside a GIS, one can construct longitudinal baselines of a given glacier, providing new insight into the localized effects of climate change. However, constructing a comprehensive and accurate baseline is far from easy, given the variety of sensors, data formats, geographic projections, and image band information that can be associated with remote sensing data products. To overcome these issues, I developed a flexible workflow to properly integrate data from a variety of sensors, including aerial imagery, drone captures, natural-color satellite imagery, and multispectral satellite imagery. This new workflow greatly enhances longitudinal glacier studies, by increasing the number of unique data sources that can be incorperated into a baseline. Modified versions of this workflow have since guided recent remote sensing-based glaciology projects I've pursued in Alaska, Peru, and Chile.   <br><br>
A version of this workflow is included below, which was used to integrate data from five platforms into a continuous baseline for multiple glaciers in Alaska's Juneau Icefield. An example product is also included to highlight a deliverable from the project.
