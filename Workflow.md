In recent years the glaciology community has embraced the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for glacier mapping at scale. We've seen several organizations follow this direction, offering innovations such as the Glacier Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) project, a global database for glacier data which includes remote sensing-derived extent measurements. By leveraging remote sensing data inside a GIS one can construct superb longitudinal baselines of a given glacier, providing previously unseen insight into the localized effects of climate change. However, constructing a comprehensive and accurate baseline is far from easy, given the variety of sensors, data formats, geographic projections, and band information that can be associated with remote sensing data products. To overcome these issues, I developed a flexible workflow to properly integrate data from a variety of sensors, including aerial imagery, natural-color satellite imagery, and multispectral satellite imagery. We highlight the ability of this workflow to enhance longitudinal glacier studies, by increasing the number of unique data sources that can be drawn from in the creation of a baseline. Modified versions of this workflow have since guided recent remote sensing-based glaciology projects I've pursued in Alaska, Peru, and Chile.   <br>
We include a version of this workflow below, used to integrate data from three platforms into a continuous baseline for five glaciers in Alaska's Juneau Icefield. An example product is also included to highlight some of the deliverables from the project.
