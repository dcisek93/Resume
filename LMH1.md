A thought experiment about what a new generation of Airship might mean for augmenting trade in Africa. Lockheed Martin's recently developed LMH-1 is a hybrid airship with an impressive range and cargo capacity. What could this platform offer to those seeking to build a robust trade network across the Sahara desert? Difficult terrain, pockets of violence, lack of infrastructure, and other challenges have made scaling up trans-Saharan trade all but impossible - perhaps until now. This map series presents a perspective on how the LMH-1 could bridge the gap between sub-Saharan economic hubs and key deep water ports. Sites were chosen with respect to the African Union's Agenda 2063, the USAID-funded West Africa Trade & Investment Hub (Trade Hub), and other source of economic data.
