The rise of social media has created a paradigm shift in the way that information is accessed and shared on an individual level, as well on a global scale. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook provide easy access to a range of content that can create, augment, and proliferate both accurate and misleading information on a wide range of subjects. At no time has this been of more importance than the present, with no end in sight yet to the global Covid-19 pandemic. The fight to communicate accurate information about COVID-19 and dispel misinformation has never been more hotly contested, with researchers coining the term infodemic to capture the growing risks associated with the spread of misinformation. Understanding public sentiment around COVID-19 is a necessity for governments, health organizations, and other relevant parties, as it provides invaluable insight into the spread of information during a pandemic, identifying the most effective avenues to disseminate verified information, provide updates, and advocate for broad social responsibility. 
<br> <br> 
With that in mind, this study seeks to bring insight to one piece of this problem, assessing public sentiment expressed on Twitter towards COVID-19 vaccines. To achieve this goal, three main goals were identified:

<ul>
  <li>Train a BERT model to assess public emotion and sentiment on Twitter conscerning COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States</li>
  <li>Construct an API to enable rapid ingest and interpretation of real-time tweets on this topic</li>
  <li>Case Study: Investigate the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in the United States, visualize its effects on Twitter-based public emotion, and provide resources to enable future research 
</li>
</ul>
