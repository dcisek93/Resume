My senior capstone project focused on image registration - mathematical approaches to aligning, adjusting, and overlaying images. This topic has huge applicability in several fields including GIS and medical imaging, and gave me a fantastic background in understanding the mathematics that govern the transformations we take for granted in GIS and computer vision. This was a useful bottom-up introduction to solving imagery-centric problems, and has influenced the way in which I approach problems since. On a broader level, my background in mathematics taught me a structured way to deconstruct, analyze, and solve difficult problems. This methodical and focused approach to problem solving guides my work each and every day. <br> 

In this paper, I focused specifically on Ordinary Procrustes Analysis (OPA), an approach to registering two images. Here we rely upon a popular definition of registration taken from the medical community - "to produce as output a geometrical transformation that aligns corresponding points and can serve as input to a system further along in the chain from image acquisition to patient benefit.‚Äù In this context, we use registration as a tool to combine and make sense of images with the end goal of helping the patient. OPA is a popular approach to registration, which establishes one of the shapes to serve as a template, and maps the other image to the template through a series of geometric transformations. In this paper we expanded upon three transformations:  Translation, Uniform Scaling, and Rotation, and expounded upon the mathematics that drive them.
